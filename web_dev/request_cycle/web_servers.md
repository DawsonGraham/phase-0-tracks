	- the freedom to run the program for any purpose
	- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
	- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
	- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

This would be an advantage if, for example, certain customers had high-level access to that operating system instance, so they could install almost any software that runs on that OS.
