- I plan to approach this JQuery studying session by utilizing a quiet, private space with strong wi-fi connection. I will use many of the professional resources online such as W3, Mozilla, etc. I will also look at community forums such as Stack Overflow, however I tend to 'read with caution' as I know the answers can be varied and sometimes way off track. I will try to stop around every 5-10 minutes to test what I learn. I usually learn much better by trying things out than just reading them from text. I think breaks are important, however I also feel that if you get in a rhythym then you should just keep moving and keep learning until you need a break.

Best strategies from my studying:
- I like to envision jquery scripts similar to CSS stylesheets in the way they both link to the index page and use similar syntax in their referencing of elements from the index page.
- It looks like JQuery can either be downloaded locally or I can use a CDN from Google or others.
- Many different sources to choose from in terms of downloading. Need to figure out why mine isn't working. I linked everything correctly in my html file but for some reason my jquery commands aren't properly functioning for my project.
