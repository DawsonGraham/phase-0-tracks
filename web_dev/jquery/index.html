         <p>This page is dedicated to the television show called Vikings. Vikings has just finished its 5th season on the History channel. The historical action-drama series is written and created by Michael Hirst, and it is filmed in Ireland. It is inspired by the sagas of the Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes who led to the raids on England and France from 793AD to 845AD. </p>

      <h3 id="ragnar-header">Ragnar Lothbrok</h3>
      <p> Although he was rumored to be father to many children, the tale of Ragnar's four sons run deep within Norse history and the world when they decide to raid England in vengeance over their father's killing. The four sons are:
      <ul>
         <li><em><strong>Bjorn Ironside:</strong></em> Ragnar's oldest son of the four, who was also a legendary king of Sweden. He was given the name 'Ironside' for his durability throughout frequent raids</li>
         <li><em><strong>Ivar the Boneless:</strong></em> The fourth son of Ragnar. He was the leader of the "Great Heathen Army" in 865. This was the legendary vengeance raid that Ragnar's sons waged on now England for the killing of their father.</li>
         <li><em><strong>Hvitserk:</strong></em> Second son of Ragnar who fought in the Great Heathen Army. Usually appears to be the most cheerful of the sons.</li>
         <li><em><strong>Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye:</strong></em> The third son of Ragnar with a nasty attitude. He was killed by Ivar after he insulted him one too many times</li>
      </ul>

      <p> The offical Vikings <a href="http://www.history.com/shows/vikings">website</a> has a very nice user interface with many images, links and videos. The only bad thing about the website is that there is not any introductory text or information for users who are unaware of Vikings. I recognize many HTML elements such as the div, header, ul/li, fieldset, and many more tags. One tag that I'm not sure about is the span tag. Based on the page source, I believe that it has something to do with the details associated within the meta tags.</p>
