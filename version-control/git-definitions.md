# Git Definitions - !!!!! I MADE MINOR CHANGES !!!!!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
	-Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It is very useful to be able to see which edits were made, at what time they were made, and be able to merge files without overwriting previously made changes or doing redudant code work that was previously done.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	-A branch is a way for each developer to work simultaneously on the same files without ruining the original, or "master" file, and also without messing up each other's work. You would use one to be able to work on your section of code without running the risk of screwing up the master code or stepping on other developers toes while they're working on their section. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
	-A commit is a save point in Git. A good commit message is one that explains what was updated/edited. The commit will also have an author and a timestamp
* What is a merge conflict?
	-When integrating another branch into the main working one (master) and the merge cannot be completed due to various reasons. GitHub will tell you that you have "unmerged paths" basically stating that you have a merge conflict
